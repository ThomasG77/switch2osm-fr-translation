                <h2>Take back control of your maps</h2>
<p>Do your maps look like everyone else’s? Are you paying high fees just to include maps on your website?</p>
<p>Switch to OpenStreetMap and discover how you can build beautiful maps from the world’s best map data. We give you the data for free; you can make any map you like with it. Or benefit from the expertise of those already using OpenStreetMap. Host it on your hardware, or elsewhere. You have control.</p>
<p><strong>switch2osm.org</strong> explains how to make the switch &ndash; from first principles to technical how-tos.</p>
<h2>What people say about OpenStreetMap</h2>
<blockquote><p>“Much like Wikipedia challenged Encyclopedia Britannica and Linux took on Microsoft Windows, OpenStreetMap is battling Google Maps, and at least in some cases, it’s winning.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Read what <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/01/openstreetmap-google/">Wired has to say about people switching to OpenStreetMap</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“OpenStreetMap is all about people doing their bit, creating an incredible resource for everybody else.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the web, explains OSM at <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html">TED 2009</a>.</p>
