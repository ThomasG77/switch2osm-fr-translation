				<p>You can switch a website to OpenStreetMap in under an hour. Choose a JavaScript API and a tile provider, and you’re ready to go. Then, as your needs increase, you can consider custom tiles, either from a specialist provider or generated yourself.</p>
<h2>Choosing an API/library</h2>
<p>Unlike commercial online map providers, OpenStreetMap does not provide an “official” JavaScript library which you are required to use. Rather, you can use any library that meets your needs. The two most popular are OpenLayers and Leaflet. Both are open source.</p>

<h2>Choosing a tile provider</h2>
<p>Apart from very limited testing purposes, you should not use the tiles supplied by OpenStreetMap.org itself. OpenStreetMap is a volunteer-run non-profit body and cannot supply tiles for large-scale commercial use. Rather, you should use a third party provider that makes tiles from OSM data, or generate your own.</p>
<p>Free providers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open/map">MapQuest Open</a></li>
</ul>
