				<h2>Tile Drawer</h2>
<p><a href="http://tiledrawer.com/">Tile Drawer</a> is a free, quick-start, out-of-the-box renderer and server using the standard OSM toolchain for Amazon EC2, other virtual servers, and fresh installs of Ubuntu on any hardware. Choose a geographic area, select a map style, and Tile Drawer will upgrade your stock operating system to an working, running tile server.</p>
<p>(Amazon EC2 is fairly often used for tile hosting but has some caveats: <a href="http://www.gravitystorm.co.uk/shine/archives/2010/07/05/map-rendering-on-ec2/">see explanation</a>.)</p>
<h2>TileMill and MapBox</h2>
<p><a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> is a pre-built application containing the Mapnik rendering engine, a code editor, and a data inspector. It is available for Linux and Mac OS X. It is built by Development Seed who also offer <a href="http://mapbox.com/plans/">MapBox</a>, a paid-for hosting service for tiles created with the application.</p>
<h2>Third-party providers</h2>
<p>Several OpenStreetMap service providers will be happy to work with you to host the map tiles with the stylesheet you have designed. See the <a href="http://switch2osm.org/providers/" title="Providers">provider listing</a>.</p>
